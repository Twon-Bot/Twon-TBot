Schedule
# ⚠️  END CYCLE SCHEDULE!

## Hey, <@&1334747903427870742> .  👋 

### Since we have already verified our first 2-star pack we will show you a schedule of when each phase will start! This should help you all to have a rough idea of when we will ping you.


## 🗓️  Schedule
### These timestamps auto update to your current timezone ‼️

Adding Phase
# **⚠️ ADDING PHASE HAS BEGUN @everyone ⚠️**

If you **haven’t done it yet**, make sure to:  
### 1️⃣ **Clear your friends list** to make space for new additions.  
### 2️⃣ **Start adding friends** from the <#1334717901684346880>  
### 3️⃣ **Change your server name** to include **"# + your assigned number + your in-game name"**.  
   *Example:* **#01 YourName**  
### 4️⃣ **Set the correct emblem** as shown in <#1337594511102054531> 
### 5️⃣ **Enable your last login status** in-game so we can verify your activity.  
   *(Check <#1334887432214282303>  if you’re unsure how to do that.)*
### 6️⃣ **Start adding friends – FOLLOW THE METHOD!**  

🔹 **Step 1:** Find your column with your name and FC in it.  

🔹 **Step 2:** Look for the **yellow** cells in your column. These are the people you **must add**.  
   ⚠️ __We will be checking and punishing inactive adders__ – if you do not add the **49 required players** within 24 hours, there will be consequences.  

🔹 **Step 3:** After adding all the **yellow** players, you can send friend requests to the people in **white** to speed up the process and secure your friend slots faster.  


⏰ **Don’t delay!** If you don’t complete these steps soon, you **might not be able to participate in the next run.**  

## ‼️ **Important Notes** ‼️  
### **DON'T OPEN PACKS UNTIL YOU HAVE AT LEAST 90+ FRIENDS SO WE CAN ALLOW MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE A CHANCE ON PICKING A POSSIBLE GOOD PACK. IF YOUR STAMINA IS GETTING FULL, YOU CAN THEN OPEN ONE, BUT DISABLE WP SHARING AND THEN TURN IT ON AGAIN AFTER OPENING YOUR PACK.**  
### **WE WILL HAVE A DEADLINE OF 24H TO ADD EVERYONE TO OUR FRIEND LIST. THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF THE TIMEZONE.**

# **👥 FOR THOSE MISSING 10+ FRIENDS:**

If you’ve already sent friend requests to **all the yellow-marked people** in your column but are still missing **over 10 friends**,

Slacking Rules
# 🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT – SLACKING RULES & PUNISHMENT 🚨
Hello @everyone! 👋

We’ve noticed that some players are **not following the adding phase correctly**, which state that you **MUST ADD ALL 49 PLAYERS MARKED IN YELLOW** inside your column. **Slacking** disrupts the process and slows everyone down.

To ensure fairness, we are implementing **special punishments** for those who slack:

### ⚠️ Punishments for Slacking:
🔹 **First Offense:**
🔸 You will receive a ⚠️ **warning** and be assigned the @slacking  **role** for the next **three runs**.
🔸 Your name will be marked on the sheet.
🔸 If you complete **three runs without slacking**, the role will be removed.

🔹 **Second Offense:**
🔸 If you **slack again**, you will be 🚫 **immediately BANNED** from the server.

### ➡️ If it is still not clear consult this: ⁠(Link Slaking Role here)

---

### ❗ Some Members Have Already Been Assigned the "Slacking" Role ❗
🔴 Based on recent police scout results, some players have **already been given the Slacking role**.
🟢 However, we are giving you **ONE CHANCE** to fix this!

💬 **If you received this role and want to remove it, DM one of the following:**
📩  @#06 guigaxs, @#04 Baran, **or any** @Moderator 

### ~ The Mod Team 🛠️
